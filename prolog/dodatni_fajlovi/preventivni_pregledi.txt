1.ALS
Part of the definition of ALS is that it’s a progressive disease -- that is, it gets worse over time. So once you have your first diagnosis of ALS, your doctor will likely recommend repeating all the tests in 6 or more months to see whether your disease has changed at all.

Mutations in the gene known as C9orf72 have been found in about a third of all familial cases and a small percentage of sporadic ones. Scientists have also found that this defect on the C9orf72 gene is tied to what’s called “frontotemporal dementia (FTD),” an uncommon form of dementia. Some researchers think that ALS and some forms of FTD are related.

Doctors may test your breathing regularly and provide you with devices to assist your breathing at night.

2.TENSION HEADACHE
Even if you have a history of headaches, see your doctor if the pattern changes or your headaches suddenly feel different. Occasionally, headaches may indicate a serious medical condition, such as a brain tumor or rupture of a weakened blood vessel (aneurysm).


3.MIGRAINE
Abdominal problems. Certain pain relievers called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may cause abdominal pain, bleeding, ulcers and other complications, especially if taken in large doses or for a long period of time. 

While the risk is considered extremely low, taking migraine medications called triptans and antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. These medications naturally raise serotonin levels, and it is possible that combining them could cause levels that are too high.


4.PARKINSON DISEASE
Bladder problems. Parkinson's disease may cause bladder problems, including being unable to control urine or having difficulty urinating.

Lewy bodies: A person with PD may have clumps of protein in their brain known as Lewy bodies. Lewy body dementia is a different condition, but it has links with PD.

Autoimmune factors: Scientists reported in JAMA in 2017 that they had found evidence of a possible genetic link between PD and autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

In 2018, researchers investigating health records in Taiwan found that people with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) had a 1.37-higher chance of also having PD than people without ARD.
